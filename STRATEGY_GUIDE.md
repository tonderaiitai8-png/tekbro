  - Volatility 10 = ±10% max per update

### Volatility Ratings
- **Low (1-3)**: Stable blue chips (JPM, WMT, JNJ)
- **Medium (4-7)**: Standard growth stocks (AAPL, MSFT)
- **High (8-10)**: Volatile tech/crypto (NVDA, COIN, TSLA)

### Market Events (Random)
- **Trigger**: 5% chance every 2 minutes
- **Duration**: 30 seconds
- **Types**:
  - **Sector Booms**: +6% to +15% for one sector
  - **Sector Crashes**: -6% to -12% for one sector  
  - **Market-Wide**: Affects ALL stocks (±5-8%)

## Winning Strategies

### 1. **The Momentum Trader** ⚡
**Best for**: Quick XP farming, Daily challenges

**How it works**:
- Focus on HIGH volatility stocks (NVDA, TSLA, COIN)
- Buy during dips (negative % change)
- Sell on pumps (positive % change)
- Target 3-5% gains per trade

**Pros**: Fast XP, exciting gameplay
**Cons**: High risk, can lose money quickly

**Example**:
1. NVDA at $400 (-5% today) → BUY
2. Wait for bounce to $415 (+3.75%) → SELL
3. Profit = $15/share × quantity

---

### 2. **The Index Investor** 📊
**Best for**: Steady growth, Diversification achievements

**How it works**:
- Buy 5-10 different stocks across sectors
- Focus on LOW-MEDIUM volatility (AAPL, MSFT, WMT, JNJ)
- Hold for the long term
- Rebalance occasionally

**Pros**: Lower risk, unlocks "Index Fund" achievement

### 3. **The Event Sniper** 🎯
**Best for**: Maximizing profits during market events

**How it works**:
1. Keep 50% cash reserves
2. When Market Event triggers:
   - **Boom**: Buy the affected sector IMMEDIATELY
   - **Crash**: Sell holdings in that sector OR wait to buy the dip
3. Ride the 30-second event
4. Sell before event ends

**Pros**: Huge profit potential (events give 6-15% instant moves)
**Cons**: Requires quick reaction, events are rare

**Example**:
- "Tech Boom!" event → Buy AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL
- Wait 25 seconds → +8% across the board
- Sell all → Lock in gains

## Risk Management

### Golden Rules

1. **Never Go All-In**: Always keep 20-30% cash
   - Allows you to buy dips
   - Prevents forced selling at losses

2. **Set Stop-Losses Mentally**: If a stock drops 10%, consider selling
   - Cut losers early
   - Let winners run

3. **Diversify Across Sectors**: Don't put all money in Tech
   - Market events can crash entire sectors
   - Spread risk across 3-5 sectors

4. **Watch Volatility**: High volatility = high risk
   - Beginner? Stick to volatility 1-5 stocks
   - Experienced? Trade volatility 8-10 for bigger swings

5. **Use Watchlist**: Star stocks you like
   - Track them without owning
   - Buy when they dip

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Panic Selling
**Mistake**: Stock drops 5%, you sell immediately
**Why it's bad**: Stocks fluctuate naturally, often recover
**Fix**: Set a stop-loss threshold (e.g., sell only at -15%)

### ❌ Chasing Pumps
**Mistake**: Stock is +20%, you buy hoping for more
**Why it's bad**: Often peaks right after, then crashes
**Fix**: Buy red, sell green

### ❌ Ignoring Cash Reserves
**Mistake**: Investing 100% of capital
**Why it's bad**: Can't buy dips, forced to sell at losses
**Fix**: Keep 20-30% in cash always

### ❌ Over-Trading
**Mistake**: Making 20+ trades per day
**Why it's bad**: More trades ≠ more profit, often leads to losses
**Fix**: Quality > Quantity. Wait for good setups.

### ❌ Putting All Eggs in One Basket  
**Mistake**: 100% of portfolio in TSLA
**Why it's bad**: Sector crashes can wipe you out
**Fix**: Diversify across 5+ stocks

## Advanced Techniques

### Mean Reversion Trading
**Theory**: Stocks that move far from average tend to revert
**How**: If a stock is -15% today, it's likely to bounce
**When to use**: After big drops, before market events

**Theory**: Different sectors perform well at different times
**How**: When Tech crashes, rotate into Healthcare/Consumer
**When to use**: After sector-specific market events

### Pyramid Buying
**Theory**: Build positions gradually
**How**: Buy 25% now, 25% if it dips 5%, etc.
**When to use**: When uncertain about entry price
